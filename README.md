# hadooc
Markdown with domain specific extensions to easily generate documentation for HTTP API. Contains the language specification as well as the compiler to HTML. Written in Javascript for Node.js.

## Command Line Interface

The file hadooc-cli.js contains a command line interface (CLI) for hadooc compiler.
To get help execute it with parameter "--help" as below:

    ./hadooc-cli.js --help

If you have installed hadooc via npm, the CLI should be available in the path:

    hadooc --help

If not, try to execute npm link manually.

## Markdown extensions

The hadooc compiler uses the package [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to compile markdown content.
Outside hadooc specific extension you can use regular markdown, including HTML tags.
The only difference is that the hadooc compiler will add a level to all titles when defined with a hash (#).

### Metadata

The file may start by metadata, enclosed between lines that only contain --- (three dashes)
Metadata are of the format
    key: value
Where the key is not case sensitive. The hadooc compiler accepts the following key
- title
- subtitle or sub-title
- version
- date

Example

    ---
    title: My HTTP API documentation
    sub-title: For you baby
    version: hairy-wall (1.2 alpha)
    ---

### Sections of API description array

API parameters are gathered within two-column arrays which are separated into sections.
Each section starts with ** (two stars) followed by the name of the section.
A section may end in three ways:
- the start of a new section (a line that starts with two stars)
- a new markdown header (a line that starts with a hash tag)
- a line that contains only two stars

Within section one can use any markdown syntax or hadooc extension, excluding a new section itself.

Example

    # API 1.x User management API

    ## API 1.1 Login

    ** API prototype
    Explain the prototype
    ** Request parameter
    Explain the parameters

    ## API 1.2 Logout

### API Prototype

Within an API section, you can specify the prototype of your API with the command below:

    {api} VERB URL

Where VERB is the HTTP verb. For example:

    {api} POST    /users/login

### Parameter list

A parameter list item can be constructed with the command below:

    {x} pname    ptype    explanation

Where fields are
- x is the type of parameter
    - *?* for optional parameters
    - *!* for mandatory parameters
    - *?$* for optional parameters which access requires some authentication
    - *!$* for mandatory parameters which access requires some authentication
    - *-* for neutral parameter
- pname is the name of parameter
- ptype is the type of parameter
- explanation. It may contain any standard markdown (no hadooc extension). It may contain newlines, but no empty lines

The separator between the last three fields is "    " (four spaces) by default, but can be changed in the command line and the driver.
Spaces after the separator are trimmed out.

A list ends with an empty line.

Example:

    ## API 1.1 Login

    ** URL

    {api} POST /users/login

    ** Post request parameters

    {!} username    @string    The user name
    {!} password    @string    The password. Rules are
    - should *at least* contain 8 characters
    - should *not* contain the string Justin Bieber
    {?} email       @string    The email of the user

    ** JSON response parameters

    {!$} userid     @string    The userid, only if authentication succeeded

    **

#### Enumeration

An item of a list of value with explanation can be constructed with

    {-:code value} explanation

of

    {=:bold value} explanation

The explanation may contain any standard markdown (no hadooc extension).
A list of enumeration ends with am empty line.

Example

    ** User Roles
    {-:root} the king
    - can read everything
    - can write everywhere
    {-:nobody} a peasant
    {-:other} be careful

#### HTTP Codes

A list of HTTP status codes and explanation can be built wit the syntax below:

    {http:CODE} explanation

Where
- CODE is the HTTP code (e.g. 200, 400)
- explanation is free regular markdown (no hadooc extension)

The list ends with an empty line

Example:

    ** HTTP Response Status Codes

    {http:200} Success
    {http:403} The user is logged in, but does not have enough permission
    {http:500} Unable to access the data:
    - the database is off
    - the FBI was listening to the communication
    {http:503} The janitor has tripped on the server's plug, again.

    **

#### Source code (JSON Only)

Additionally to marked's ''''X (four single quotes) syntax, the hadooc compiler has its own construct for code blocks:

    {code:X}
    Your code
    {/code}

Where X is the language (only json is supported for now).
This construct may disapear in favor of four single quotes.

Example:

    {code:json}
    {
      "data": [ { "data1": "value1" } ],
      "dataNb": 1
    }
    {/code}

#### Comments

It is possible to add single-line comments with the syntax:

    ---- This is a comment

or

    ---- {XXX} This is a comment of with tag "XXX"

Where XXX is a comment tag used as prefix of the comment, and styling when comment display is turned on.
